uWSGI is also available as a package in several OS/distributions.

uWSGI has a really fast development cycle, so packages may not be up to date. Building it requires less than 30 seconds
and very few dependencies (only Python interpreter, a C compiler/linker and the libs/headers for your language of choice)
